= Java JNI & {cpp} in a single Gradle build

This Java/{cpp} sample started as a hack day initiative at Gradle.
It provided an excellent starting point to the community in showing how Gradle can build Java Native Interface (JNI) libraries.
Since then, link:https://nokee.dev/[Nokee], lead by one of the original authors of the sample, took off. Nokee is a high-quality suite of Gradle plugins specifically geared toward native development with Gradle.
It includes plugins for building JNI libraries with link:https://nokee.dev/docs/current/samples/java-c-jni-library/[C], link:https://nokee.dev/docs/current/samples/java-cpp-jni-library/[{cpp}], link:https://nokee.dev/docs/current/samples/java-objective-c-jni-library/[Objective-C], and link:https://nokee.dev/docs/current/samples/java-objective-cpp-jni-library/[Objective-{cpp}].
Have a look at the link:https://nokee.dev/docs/current/samples/#sec:samples-jni[numerous samples already available] and the link:https://nokee.dev/docs/current/manual/building-jni-projects.html[documentation on building JNI projects].
